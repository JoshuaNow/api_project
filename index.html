    I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter. But I
    thought a song would probably be a little better. Instead of a ,letter. That
    you'd probably just shred up--yeah. I stumbled on your picture yesterday and
    it made me stop and think of. How much of a waste it'd ,be for me to put
    some ink to, a stupid piece a. Paper, I'd rather let you see how. Much I
    fucking hate you in a freestyle.
